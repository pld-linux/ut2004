Starting with 3369, the game supports render-to-texture.

To enable it, you will need the Nvidia drivers of at least version 7676 and you
should edit the following: Set "UseRenderTargets=True" in the
"[OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice]" section of your UT2004.ini or Default.ini and
set "bPlayerShadows=True" and "bBlobShadow=False" in the
"[UnrealGame.UnrealPawn]" section of your User.ini or DefUser.ini.
